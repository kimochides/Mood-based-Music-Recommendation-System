Musify is an innovative web-based application that leverages sentiment analysis to enhance music recommendations based on the user's emotional state. Utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for its design, Musify interprets user inputs—either textual or through facial expressions—to determine their current mood. This mood assessment, categorized into emotions such as happiness, sadness, or anger, drives the selection of music, interfacing dynamically with the Spotify API to fetch appropriate tracks.

This project combines emotion recognition with music curation to offer playlists that resonate with the listener’s feelings, aiming to enrich the music-listening experience. By aligning music suggestions with the user’s emotional context, Musify seeks to boost user engagement and satisfaction with digital music services. This application not only showcases the practical use of sentiment analysis in entertainment technology but also illustrates the potential of machine learning to develop more intuitive user interfaces that cater to emotional and psychological needs. Musify represents a significant step towards personalized media consumption, making it a valuable model for future advancements in personalized entertainment technologies.
